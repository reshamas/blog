## Summary

scikit-learn was honored to be selected to participate in Cohort 2 of the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund (OSF) Training Program. Cohort 1 took place earlier in 2025 with 19 projects, and Cohort 2 took place with 52 projects during June 2025. 

It was an intense 3-week intense training program, with over 90 open source maintainers joining the training. Read the announcement from GitHub: [Securing the supply chain at scale: Starting with 71 important open source projects](https://github.blog/open-source/maintainers/securing-the-supply-chain-at-scale-starting-with-71-important-open-source-projects) (11-Aug-2025) 

There were numerous workshops delivered by experts in the GitHub Security Lab.

## Resources for Security Training
The training provided many trainings by experts in the field. Below we share trainings that are available to the public.

- [Configuring private vulnerability reporting for a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/configuring-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-a-repository)
>Owners and administrators of public repositories can allow security researchers to report vulnerabilities securely in the repository by enabling private vulnerability reporting.

#### Developing Secure Software
Learn the security basics to develop software that is hardened against attacks, and understand how you can reduce the damage and speed the response when a vulnerability is exploited. This course includes specific tips on how to use and develop open source and other software securely. It was developed by the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), a cross-industry collaboration that brings together leaders to improve the security of open source software by building a broader community, targeted initiatives, and best practices.

* Online, Self Paced
* 16-20 Hours of Course Material
* Quizzes and Hands-on Labs
