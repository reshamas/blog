## Summary

scikit-learn was honored to be selected to participate in Cohort 2 of the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund (OSF) Training Program. Cohort 1 took place earlier in 2025 with 19 projects, and Cohort 2 took place with 52 projects during June 2025.

It was an intense 3-week intense training program, with over 90 open source maintainers joining the training. Read the announcement from GitHub: [Securing the supply chain at scale: Starting with 71 important open source projects](https://github.blog/open-source/maintainers/securing-the-supply-chain-at-scale-starting-with-71-important-open-source-projects) 

There were numerous workshops delivered by experts in the GitHub Security Lab. For many of these workshops, the learning materials are publicly available, and they are shared below.

### GitHub Security Lab
GitHub has its own security department, and GitHub Security Lab’s mission is to empower developers and secure open source.

## Resources for Security Training
The training provided many trainings by experts in the field. Below we share trainings that are available to the public.

- [Configuring private vulnerability reporting for a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/configuring-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-a-repository)
>Owners and administrators of public repositories can allow security researchers to report vulnerabilities securely in the repository by enabling private vulnerability reporting.
- [OpenSSF Scorecard](https://securityscorecards.dev)
- [Secure by design: A UX toolkit](https://microsoft.design/articles/secure-by-design-a-ux-toolkit)

#### CodeQL: From Zero to Hero

This workshop introduces fundamentals of security research and static analysis used when looking for vulnerabilities in software. They use an example of a simple vulnerability, walk through how CodeQL could detect it, and provide examples on how the audience could use CodeQL to find vulnerabilities themselves.

#### Developing Secure Software

This course includes specific tips on how to use and develop open source and other software securely. Learn the security basics to develop software that is hardened against attacks, and understand how you can reduce the damage and speed the response when a vulnerability is exploited. 

It was developed by the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), a cross-industry collaboration that brings together leaders to improve the security of open source software by building a broader community, targeted initiatives, and best practices.

* Online, Self Paced
* 16-20 Hours of Course Material
* Quizzes and Hands-on Labs

### Secure Code Game
Secure Code Game is a GitHub Security Lab initiative, providing an in-repo learning experience, where learners to secure intentionally vulnerable code. At the same time, this is an open source project that welcomes your contributions as a way to give back to the community.
